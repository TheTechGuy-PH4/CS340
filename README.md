-Writing this code, I wanted to make sure this was as smooth as possible. So trying to follow best practices, as in making modules so that the app is flexible to use. I think making the CRUD file first then learning how to connect to the database was a good building step to get to the overall goal. 
- As a computer scientist, I now approach problems thinking that there is some way I could automate this by creating an app or something along those lines. I think I approached this project like any other. Gather the requirements and slowly work my way to overall goal. 
- I think computer scientist find a way to make the world a more efficient place to be in through tech. I think work like this one shows how technology can reach to any area or career in the world.
